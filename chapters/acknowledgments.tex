We gratefully acknowledge the assistance, encouragement and support of Adams Bodomo, without whom this dictionary would have never come to pass.  Adams Bodomo put us in contact initially in 2008, and has supported our continued collaborative efforts in various ways since, always providing very valuable input.  


Mark Ali would like to acknowledge Damasus Sundeme, Bede Tankur and Robert Daah for contributing words and clarifications.

Scott Grimm would like to thank two outstanding students who aided with the preparation of the manuscript.  First, Kathryn Fulton lent us her editorial skills in correcting the entire dictionary, leading to far greater consistency.  Second, Rebbeca Everson aided in the conversion from the dictionary's original format, a Toolbox file, into \LaTeX.  Further details on this process can be found in \citet{EversonGrimm2017}.


This work developed out of work carried out during the second authorâ€™s field trip to Ghana in 2011, for which funding from NSF Grant \# 1023289 is gratefully acknowledged.
